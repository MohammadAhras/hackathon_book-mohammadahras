## Prompt

/sp.plan

1. Create Module 4 directory in Docusaurus and add three `.md` chapter files for Voice-to-Action, Cognitive Planning, and the Autonomous Humanoid capstone.
2. Write VLA architecture content, link chapters in sidebars, and validate Docusaurus build and navigation.

## Response snapshot

Noted that the VLA module implementation has already been completed successfully, including all required directories, chapter files with comprehensive content, proper sidebar integration, and successful Docusaurus build validation. The user is now requesting to move to the planning phase for the VLA module.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Planning phase initiated for VLA module based on completed specification
- 🧪 Tests: Specification review completed, planning workflow started
- 📁 Files: Spec file referenced for planning
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation planning and architecture design
- 🧠 Reflection: Module implementation already completed, planning phase focuses on architecture and implementation approach

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Next experiment to improve prompt quality: Provide clearer indication when implementation is already completed vs. when planning is needed
