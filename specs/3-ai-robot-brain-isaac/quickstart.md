# Quickstart: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Getting Started with NVIDIA Isaac for Humanoid Robots

This quickstart guide provides a high-level overview of the three main components covered in Module 3: Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 Navigation.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with Python agents and rclpy
- Knowledge of URDF and robot modeling
- Understanding of digital twin simulation concepts

### Chapter 1: Isaac Sim and Synthetic Worlds
1. **Install Isaac Sim** from NVIDIA Omniverse
2. **Create your first synthetic environment** with photorealistic rendering
3. **Generate synthetic training data** using domain randomization
4. **Validate environment** with humanoid robot simulation

### Chapter 2: Isaac ROS and Visual SLAM
1. **Set up Isaac ROS packages** with GPU acceleration
2. **Configure camera calibration** for visual perception
3. **Implement Visual SLAM pipeline** for localization
4. **Perform 3D reconstruction** from visual data

### Chapter 3: Nav2 Navigation Stack
1. **Configure Nav2 for humanoid navigation** with appropriate parameters
2. **Set up costmaps** for obstacle detection and avoidance
3. **Implement path planning** algorithms for bipedal locomotion
4. **Test navigation behaviors** with behavior trees

### Key Concepts
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Using Isaac Sim to create training data for AI models
