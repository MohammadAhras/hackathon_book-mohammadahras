# Introduction to ROS 2 Robotics Module

Welcome to the ROS 2 Robotics Module! This educational module is designed for AI students entering physical and humanoid robotics. Here you will learn how ROS 2 serves as the middleware enabling AI agents to control humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### 1. ROS 2 Fundamentals
Learn the core concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, and actions. Understand the ROS 2 communication model and the role of ROS 2 in physical AI systems.

### 2. Python Agents with rclpy
Discover how to create ROS 2 nodes in Python using rclpy. Learn to connect AI logic to robot controllers and implement publishing, subscribing, and service calls.

### 3. Humanoid Modeling with URDF
Explore how to model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format). Understand how to represent humanoid anatomy and the role of URDF in simulation and control.

## Getting Started

Start with the [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals/index.md) chapter to build a foundation for controlling humanoid robots. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing you with comprehensive knowledge of ROS 2 for robotics applications.

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI students who are entering the field of physical and humanoid robotics. It assumes basic programming knowledge and provides content accessible to intermediate-advanced developers with a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12.
