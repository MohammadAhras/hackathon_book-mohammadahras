# Digital Twin Simulation

Welcome to the Digital Twin Simulation module! This section will teach you about physics-based simulation and digital twin creation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity.

## What You'll Learn

This module is organized into three main chapters:

### 1. Physics Simulation with Gazebo
Learn about gravity, collisions, and dynamics in Gazebo physics simulation. Understand world and robot simulation basics, and the role of Gazebo in robotics testing.

### 2. High-Fidelity Environments with Unity
Explore visual realism and interaction in Unity environments. Learn about human-robot interaction scenarios and how Unity's role complements Gazebo in the simulation workflow.

### 3. Sensor Simulation
Discover LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and sensor noise modeling. Understand simulation-to-reality considerations for creating realistic digital twins.

## Getting Started

Start with the [Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-gazebo/intro.md) chapter to build a foundation for digital twin creation. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing you with comprehensive knowledge of simulation techniques for robotics applications.

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and robotics students building simulated physical environments. It assumes basic robotics knowledge and provides content accessible to intermediate-advanced developers with a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12.
