# Sensor Simulation

Welcome to the Sensor Simulation chapter! This section will teach you about LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, sensor noise modeling, and simulation-to-reality considerations for creating realistic digital twins.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Simulate various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Implement realistic sensor noise modeling
- Understand sensor realism considerations
- Address simulation-to-reality considerations and domain adaptation

## Chapter Overview

Sensor simulation is critical for creating realistic digital twins that can effectively train and test robot perception and navigation systems. This includes:

- LiDAR simulation with point cloud generation
- Depth camera simulation with realistic noise models
- IMU simulation with acceleration and orientation data
- Realistic noise modeling to bridge simulation-to-reality gap

This chapter covers:

1. **LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs** - Simulating different sensor types
2. **Sensor Noise and Realism** - Implementing realistic noise models
3. **Simulation-to-Reality Considerations** - Bridging the gap between simulation and reality

## Prerequisites
