# ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the ROS 2 Fundamentals chapter! This section will introduce you to the core concepts of ROS 2, which serves as the middleware enabling AI agents to control humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Understand the ROS 2 communication model
- Describe the role of ROS 2 in physical AI systems
- Identify how ROS 2 facilitates communication between AI algorithms and robot controllers

## Chapter Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

This chapter covers the essential building blocks of ROS 2 that form the foundation for all robotics applications:

1. **Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions** - The fundamental communication primitives
2. **Communication Model** - How these primitives work together
3. **Role in Physical AI** - How ROS 2 bridges AI and robotics

## Next Steps

Continue with the next articles in this chapter to dive deeper into each concept:

- [Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions](./nodes-topics-services-actions.md) - Learn about the core communication primitives
- [Communication Model](./communication-model.md) - Understand how ROS 2 components interact
- [Role in Physical AI](./role-in-physical-ai.md) - Explore how ROS 2 enables AI-robot interaction
